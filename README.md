This is a command line interface (CLI) tool that helps you calculate how much money you need to add to your debit card to reach its maintaining balance and pay your credit card bill using your debit card.

## Usage
To use the tool, run the following command in your terminal:

node index.js
```
The tool will prompt you to enter the following information:

- Your debit card maintaining balance
- Your credit card bill
Enter the required information when prompted.

The tool will then calculate how much money you need to add to your debit card to reach its maintaining balance and pay your credit card bill using your debit card.
